# GitHub Configuration Guide

## ✅ What You've Already Done

- ✅ NuGet API Key configured
- ✅ GitHub Pages enabled

Great! Now let's complete the remaining optional configurations.

---

## 📖 1. GitHub Pages Configuration

Since you've already enabled GitHub Pages, let's verify the settings:

### Verify GitHub Pages Settings

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/jdtoon/CloudflareD1.NET
2. Click **Settings** (top menu)
3. Click **Pages** (left sidebar)
4. Verify these settings:
   - **Source**: Should be set to **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch")
   - If it says "Deploy from a branch", change it to "GitHub Actions"

### What I Just Created

I've created a new workflow file: `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml`

This workflow will:
- Automatically build and deploy your Docusaurus documentation
- Trigger when you push changes to the `docs/` folder
- Make your docs available at: **https://jdtoon.github.io/CloudflareD1.NET/**

### Test the Deployment

1. Commit the new workflow file:
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment workflow"
   git push origin master
   ```

2. Watch it deploy:
   - Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
   - You should see "Deploy Documentation" workflow running
   - Wait for it to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)

3. Visit your documentation:
   - After deployment completes, visit: https://jdtoon.github.io/CloudflareD1.NET/

## 🏷️ 2. Repository Topics (For Discoverability)

**What are Repository Topics?**

Topics are tags/keywords that help people discover your repository when searching GitHub. Think of them like hashtags for your repo.

### How to Add Topics

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/jdtoon/CloudflareD1.NET
2. Look at the **About** section (top right, below the repository description)
3. Click the **⚙️ gear icon** next to "About"
4. You'll see a field called **Topics**

### Recommended Topics to Add

Copy and paste these topics one by one (GitHub will suggest them as you type):

```
cloudflare
cloudflare-d1
d1-database
dotnet
csharp
dotnet-standard
database
sqlite
nuget
nuget-package
serverless
edge-computing
rest-api
orm
database-client
workers
cloudflare-workers
```

**Why these topics?**
- `cloudflare`, `cloudflare-d1`, `d1-database` - Help Cloudflare users find your library
- `dotnet`, `csharp`, `dotnet-standard` - Help .NET developers find it
- `database`, `sqlite` - Help people searching for database tools
- `nuget`, `nuget-package` - Help people looking for NuGet packages
- `serverless`, `edge-computing`, `workers` - Reach the serverless community
- `rest-api`, `orm`, `database-client` - Technical categorization

### Also Update the Description

While you're in the About section, set:
- **Description**: `.NET adapter for Cloudflare D1 database with local SQLite support`
- **Website**: `https://jdtoon.github.io/CloudflareD1.NET`
- Check ✅ **"Use your GitHub Pages website"**

## 🛡️ 3. Branch Protection (Master Branch)

**What is Branch Protection?**

Branch protection prevents accidental changes to your main branch and ensures quality through:
- Requiring pull requests before merging
- Requiring tests to pass before merging
- Preventing force pushes

### How to Enable Branch Protection

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/jdtoon/CloudflareD1.NET
2. Click **Settings** → **Branches** (left sidebar)
3. Click **Add branch protection rule**

### Recommended Settings

**Branch name pattern:**
```
master
```

**Enable these options:**

✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
   - Require approvals: `1` (or leave at 0 if you're working solo)
   - Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed

✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
   - Click "Add status check" and search for:
     - `build-and-test` (from your CI/CD workflow)
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging

✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**
   - Ensures all PR comments are addressed

✅ **Do not allow bypassing the above settings**
   - Even for administrators (optional but recommended)

**Optional but useful:**
- ✅ Require linear history (keeps clean git history)
- ✅ Require signed commits (for extra security)

**Click "Create"** when done.

### What This Means for Your Workflow

After enabling branch protection:
- You can't push directly to `master`
- You must create a branch, then make a pull request
- Tests must pass before you can merge

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/add-something

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/add-something

# Then create a Pull Request on GitHub
# Once tests pass, merge it
```

**If you're working solo and this feels too restrictive**, you can:
- Skip branch protection for now
- Or enable it but check "Allow specified actors to bypass" and add yourself

## 🔒 4. Additional Security Settings (Bonus)

Since we're configuring things, let's enable security features:

### Enable Dependabot

1. Go to **Settings** → **Code security and analysis**
2. Enable:
   - ✅ **Dependency graph** (should be on by default)
   - ✅ **Dependabot alerts**
   - ✅ **Dependabot security updates**

This will automatically:
- Alert you to security vulnerabilities in your dependencies
- Create PRs to update vulnerable packages

### Enable Secret Scanning

Still in **Code security and analysis**:
- ✅ **Secret scanning** - Detects accidentally committed API keys

---

## 📊 5. Verify Everything Works

### Checklist

Run through this checklist to make sure everything is configured:

- [ ] **NuGet API Key**: Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → Verify `NUGET_API_KEY` exists
- [ ] **GitHub Pages**: Go to **Settings** → **Pages** → Verify "Source" is "GitHub Actions"
- [ ] **Topics Added**: Check the repo homepage → About section shows your topics
- [ ] **Branch Protection**: Go to **Settings** → **Branches** → Verify rule for `master` exists
- [ ] **Security Features**: Go to **Settings** → **Code security** → Verify Dependabot is enabled

### Test Your CI/CD

Make a small change to trigger both workflows:

```bash
# Update the CHANGELOG
echo "\n## Testing CI/CD - $(date)" >> CHANGELOG.md

git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Test CI/CD pipelines"
git push origin master
```

Then watch:
1. **Actions** tab → "Build and Publish" workflow should run and publish to NuGet
2. **Actions** tab → "Deploy Documentation" workflow should run and deploy docs
3. Check https://jdtoon.github.io/CloudflareD1.NET/ after a few minutes

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### GitHub Pages not deploying?

Check:
1. **Settings** → **Pages** → Source is "GitHub Actions" (not "branch")
2. **Actions** tab → Check if "Deploy Documentation" workflow ran
3. Look at workflow logs for errors

### Branch protection blocking you?

If branch protection is too strict:
1. **Settings** → **Branches** → Click "Edit" on your rule
2. Scroll down → Check "Allow specified actors to bypass"
3. Add yourself to the bypass list

### Need help?

- Check the workflow logs in the **Actions** tab
- Feel free to ask questions!
